##### My favourite location in the world is 'Switzerland'

Switzerland is located in **Europe**.The amazing mountains, heaps of lakes and beautiful villages make for the most beautiful scenery in Switzerland. Each city in Switzerland has its own individuality, with different landscapes and their unique city life. I like it as it is known for the **sceneric** places.

## Code Fencing

> A numerical method is a mathematical tool designed to solve numerical problems. The implementation of a numerical method with an appropriate convergence check in a programming language is called a numerical algorithm.

>Simpson's rules are several approximations for definite integrals, named after Thomas Simpson. The most basic of these rules, called Simpson's 1/3 rule, or just Simpson's rule. Link to the Source - <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_rule>

~~~ 
const int N = 1000 * 1000; // number of steps (already multiplied by 2)
double simpson_integration(double a, double b){
    double h = (b - a) / N;
    double s = f(a) + f(b); // a = x_0 and b = x_2n
    for (int i = 1; i <= N - 1; ++i) { // Refer to final Simpson's formula
        double x = a + h * i;
        s += f(x) * ((i & 1) ? 4 : 2);
    }
    s *= h / 3;
    return s;
